# Braised Pork with Fermented Tofu (腐乳肉 福禄寿)

This festive dish features succulent pork belly braised with aromatic spices and fermented tofu, then expertly prepared to achieve a tender texture with a glossy, flavorful sauce.

## Ingredients:

*   **Pork:** 1 large piece of black pork belly (黑猪肉 / 野山猪), about 1-1.5 kg
*   **Braising Spices:**
    *   Small fennel (小茴香) - a pinch
    *   Cinnamon stick (桂皮) - 1 piece
    *   Star anise (大料) - 3-4 pieces
    *   Scallions (葱) - 2-3 pieces, smashed
    *   Ginger (姜) - several slices
*   **Liquids & Seasoning:**
    *   Shaoxing wine (黄酒 / 老饭骨的酒) - for blanching and sauce
    *   Dark soy sauce (老抽) - for color and flavor
    *   Water - sufficient to cover pork for blanching/braising
    *   Red fermented tofu (腐乳) - several cubes, mashed into a paste
    *   Sugar (糖) - to taste, for finishing sauce
    *   Cornstarch slurry (水淀粉) - for thickening sauce
    *   Sesame oil (香油) - a drizzle, for finishing sauce
*   **For Deep Frying:**
    *   Cooking oil (油) - sufficient for deep frying
*   **Garnish:**
    *   Orange slices (or other citrus)
    *   Fresh parsley

## Instructions:

1.  **Blanch the Pork Belly:**
    *   Place the raw pork belly in a wok or large pot.
    *   Add small fennel, cinnamon, star anise, smashed scallions, and ginger slices.
    *   Pour in Shaoxing wine (老饭骨的酒) and dark soy sauce until the pork is mostly submerged. Add water if necessary to fully cover.
    *   Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a low simmer.
    *   Braise the pork belly until it is cooked through but not completely tender, about 30 minutes (or longer if starting with very raw, unprocessed pork). The goal is for it to be "断生" (cooked through).
    *   *Note: No vinegar or sesame oil should be added at this stage.*

2.  **Prepare for Deep Frying:**
    *   Carefully remove the blanched pork belly from the braising liquid.
    *   Rub dark soy sauce generously over all sides, especially the skin, to help with coloring during frying.

3.  **Deep Fry the Pork Belly:**
    *   Heat a generous amount of cooking oil in a clean wok until the oil is hot and ready for frying. The wider the oil surface, the better the frying.
    *   Carefully place the pork belly into the hot oil. Deep-fry until the skin is golden brown and crispy, developing a "tiger skin" (虎皮) texture. This helps create a soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture later.
    *   Remove the fried pork belly from the oil once evenly colored and crispy.

4.  **Soften the Pork:**
    *   Return the deep-fried pork belly to the wok with some of the original braising liquid (or fresh water if preferred) for a brief simmer. This step helps to re-soften the skin and meat, creating a desirable texture.

5.  **Slice and Arrange:**
    *   Once the pork belly has softened slightly, remove it from the wok.
    *   Slice the pork belly into uniform pieces, ensuring consistent length and thickness.
    *   Arrange the sliced pork belly neatly in a heatproof bowl.

6.  **Prepare Red Fermented Tofu Sauce:**
    *   In a small bowl, mash the red fermented tofu cubes into a smooth paste.
    *   Take a portion of the braising liquid from step 1. In a separate wok, combine this braising liquid with additional Shaoxing wine and sugar. Bring to a simmer.
    *   Add the mashed red fermented tofu to this simmering liquid, stirring well.
    *   *Note: The video implies this red sauce is primarily for flavor and color during steaming, not for final thickening yet.*

7.  **Steam the Pork Belly:**
    *   Pour the prepared red fermented tofu sauce mixture evenly over the sliced pork belly in the bowl.
    *   Place the bowl in a steamer. Steam for at least 40 minutes, or longer (up to 2 hours) for maximum tenderness and flavor infusion. The softer it steams, the better it tastes ("蒸得越烂越好吃").

8.  **Plate and Finish the Sauce:**
    *   Carefully remove the steamed pork from the steamer.
    *   Place a serving plate upside down over the steamed pork. Invert the bowl and plate together to transfer the pork onto the plate. *Tip: Hold the pork with a spoon while inverting to prevent it from falling apart.*
    *   Collect the remaining steaming liquid from the inverted bowl.
    *   Heat this collected liquid in a clean wok. Add a drizzle of sesame oil (do not let the aroma evaporate by overheating).
    *   Thicken the sauce with cornstarch slurry until it reaches a desired glossy consistency ("勾芡").

9.  **Garnish and Serve:**
    *   Pour the hot, thickened sauce over the plated pork belly.
    *   Arrange fresh orange slices around the base of the pork and garnish with fresh parsley.
    *   Serve hot. This dish is said to be "肥而不腻" (fatty but not greasy) and is made with "野山猪" (wild boar) for extra flavor.
