**Cook time:** 40 minutes

## Ingredients:

*   **Sea Cucumber:** 8-10 pieces (pre-soaked/rehydrated, good quality with thick flesh)
*   **Large Scallions (white parts):** 10-12 pieces (e.g., Zhangqiu scallions), cut into 5-6 cm segments
*   **Ginger:** 3-4 slices
*   **Garlic:** 4-5 cloves, lightly smashed
*   **Cilantro:** 1 small bunch
*   **Cooking Oil:** Ample, for deep-frying (approx. 2-3 cups)

### For Blanching Sea Cucumber:

*   **Salt:** 1 teaspoon
*   **Light Soy Sauce:** 1 tablespoon
*   **White Pepper:** 1/4 teaspoon
*   **Yellow Wine (Shaoxing wine):** 1 tablespoon

---

### For Braising Sauce:

*   **Sugar (for caramelization):** 2-3 tablespoons
*   **Yellow Wine (Shaoxing wine):** 2 tablespoons
*   **Mineral Water:** 2-3 cups (or chicken broth)
*   **Dark Soy Sauce:** 1 tablespoon (for color)
*   **Sugar (for flavor balance):** 1-2 teaspoons
*   **Salt:** 1/2 teaspoon (or to taste, to balance sweetness)
*   **Starch Slurry:** 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 2 tablespoons cold water
*   **Cooking Wine (for finishing):** 1 tablespoon

## Instructions:

1.  **Prepare Scallion Aromatic Oil:**
    *   Heat a wok with a generous amount of cooking oil (enough to deep-fry the scallions).
    *   Add scallion segments, ginger slices, smashed garlic, and cilantro to the hot oil.
    *   Deep-fry over medium heat until the scallions turn golden brown and fragrant. The cilantro will become crispy.
    *   Remove the cilantro once its aroma has infused the oil and discard it.
    *   Continue frying the scallions, ginger, and garlic until they achieve a rich golden color.
    *   Carefully strain the fried scallions, ginger, and garlic, reserving the aromatic oil. Place the strained aromatics in a heatproof bowl.
    *   Cover the bowl with a lid and steam for about 10 minutes (using a steamer over boiling water) to soften the scallions and further enhance their aroma. Set aside.

2.  **Prepare Sea Cucumber:**
    *   Ensure sea cucumbers are properly rehydrated, cleaned (cut open, remove internal organs), and rinsed. Pat dry any excess water.
    *   In a clean wok, bring water to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon light soy sauce, white pepper, and 1 tablespoon yellow wine.
    *   Add the rehydrated sea cucumbers and blanch them briefly (1-2 minutes) until they swell slightly. Remove and set aside.
    *   Heat the reserved aromatic oil in the wok until it reaches about 180°C (medium-high heat).
    *   Quickly flash-fry the blanched sea cucumbers for about 30 seconds. This step is crucial for flavor absorption and texture. Remove and set aside.

3.  **Make the Braising Sauce:**
    *   Clean the wok and add a small amount of fresh cooking oil.
    *   Add 2-3 tablespoons of sugar. Stir constantly over low heat to caramelize the sugar (炒糖色).
    *   The sugar will melt, turn into small bubbles, then larger bubbles, and finally foam with almost no bubbles as it darkens to a deep amber color. This is the critical moment for achieving a rich color and subtle smoky flavor without bitterness.
    *   Immediately add the flash-fried sea cucumbers to the caramelized sugar.
    *   Pour in 2 tablespoons of yellow wine, mineral water (or broth), and dark soy sauce.
    *   Add the second portion of sugar (1-2 teaspoons) and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
    *   Bring the sauce to a simmer, then add the steamed scallions and ginger from step 1.
    *   Cover the wok and braise on low heat for 15-20 minutes, or until the sea cucumber has absorbed the flavors and is tender.

4.  **Finish and Serve:**
    *   Remove the lid and increase the heat to reduce the sauce slightly.
    *   Stir in the starch slurry gradually, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens to a glossy consistency that "pulls" and clings to the sea cucumber. Avoid over-thickening.
    *   Turn off the heat and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of cooking wine for extra aroma and shine.
    *   Carefully transfer the braised sea cucumber and scallions to a serving plate, arranging the scallions as a base and the sea cucumber on top.
    *   Garnish with fresh cucumber slices around the edge for a refreshing contrast. Serve immediately.

## Tips from the Chef:

*   **Scallion Choice:** Use long, fresh scallions (like Zhangqiu scallions) and avoid cutting them too small to preserve their unique flavor and texture.
*   **Cilantro Removal:** Cilantro is only used to infuse the oil with aroma; remove it before it overcooks and imparts a bitter taste.
*   **Steaming Aromatics:** Steaming the fried scallions, ginger, and garlic in the residual oil after frying softens them and further deepens their aromatic profile, preventing them from being tough or burnt.
*   **Caramelization Technique:** Achieving the perfect caramel color without bitterness is key. Stir sugar slowly over low heat until it reaches a deep amber color and the bubbles almost disappear. This precise moment ensures a rich flavor and beautiful hue.
*   **Balanced Sweetness:** The two-stage sugar addition (caramelization for color/aroma, direct addition for sweetness) along with salt, creates a complex, balanced sweet-and-savory flavor profile, preventing the dish from being cloyingly sweet.
*   **Finishing Oil:** A final drizzle of cooking wine just before serving adds a bright, aromatic sheen to the dish.
